# Blockchain voting system  

Solidity smart contract for voting on what action the robot should do.
You can connect with MetaMask on the Goerli test network.

 Backend enables adding new voting options, for more dynamic usages. The targeted voting options are "alien", "dance 1", "dance 2". Based on the votes on each of these, the robot would run a certain autonomous path.
